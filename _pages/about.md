Welcom to Youqi Li's homepage!

I am an assistant professor (master advisor) at the [School of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.bit.edu.cn/), [Beijing Institute of Technology](http://www.bit.edu.cn/). I receivd a B.S. from the School of Computer Science and Technology at [Beijing Institute of Technology](http://www.bit.edu.cn/), and a Ph.D. from the School of Computer Science and Technology at [Beijing Institute of Technology](http://www.bit.edu.cn/) under the supervision of [Prof. Fan Li](https://cs.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jsml/js/lf/index.htm). I was a Post-Doctoral Fellow in the [School of Cyberspace Science and Technology](https://cst.bit.edu.cn/) at [Beijing Institute of Technology](http://www.bit.edu.cn/), working with [Prof. Liehuang Zhu](https://cst.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jsml/bssds/2515180f56bf4a30b0bb672dfab8391d.htm) and [Prof. Fan Li](https://cs.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jsml/js/lf/index.htm).

Research Interests
------
I am broadly interested in problems/scenarios: crowdsourcing/crowdsensing, federated learning, incentive mechanism, bandit and AI security. I focus on the theoretical research using tools including optimization and machine/deep learning. I'm looking for highly motivated master students, undergraduate students and research interns with strong technical background to work together on these areas. If you are interested, please send an email with your CV and transcripts attached.
