Welcom to Youqi Li's homepage!

I am an assistant professor (master advisor) at the [School of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.bit.edu.cn/), [Beijing Institute of Technology](http://www.bit.edu.cn/). I receivd a B.S. from the School of Computer Science and Technology at [Beijing Institute of Technology](http://www.bit.edu.cn/), and a Ph.D. from the School of Computer Science and Technology at [Beijing Institute of Technology](http://www.bit.edu.cn/) under the supervision of [Prof. Fan Li](https://cs.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jsml/js/lf/index.htm). I was a Post-Doctoral Fellow in the [School of Cyberspace Science and Technology](https://cst.bit.edu.cn/) at [Beijing Institute of Technology](http://www.bit.edu.cn/), working with [Prof. Liehuang Zhu](https://cst.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jsml/bssds/2515180f56bf4a30b0bb672dfab8391d.htm) and [Prof. Fan Li](https://cs.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jsml/js/lf/index.htm).

Research Interests
------
I am broadly interested in problems/scenarios: crowdsourcing/crowdsensing, federated learning, incentive mechanism, and AI security. I focus on the theoretical research using tools including optimization and machine/deep learning. I am looking for MPhil, and undergraduate students with strong background to work together on these areas.
